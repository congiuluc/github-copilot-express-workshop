# Prebuild Configuration Recommendations:
# - Region: Auto (recommended) or your preferred region
# - Machine type: 2-core (sufficient for development)
# - Triggers: 
#   - Push to main branch
#   - Configuration file changes
#   - Scheduled daily rebuild
# - Timeout: 30 minutes (enough for all language installations)
